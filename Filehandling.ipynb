        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "- Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript) execute code line by line at runtime, making them easier to debug but slower.\n",
        "Compiled languages (e.g., C, C++) translate the entire code into machine language before execution, making them faster but requiring compilation before running.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling allows you to catch and handle errors during program execution, preventing crashes. It uses:\n",
        "\n",
        "    try: Code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "    except: Handles the error.\n",
        "\n",
        "    else: Runs if no error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "    finally: Always runs, used for cleanup.\n",
        "    \n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It is mainly used for cleanup operations, like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging is used to track events, errors, and debugging information in a program. The logging module helps developers monitor and troubleshoot issues without using print().\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is a destructor that is automatically called when an object is deleted or garbage collected. It is used to release resources like closing files or network connections.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- import module: Imports the entire module, use module.function().\n",
        "from module import function: Imports specific functions, use them directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- Handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or a single except with a tuple. Multiple except blocks catch specific errors separately, while a tuple allows handling multiple exceptions in one block. This ensures better error handling and program stability.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement automatically handles file closing, preventing resource leaks. It ensures the file is properly closed after operations, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "9.  What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading: Runs multiple threads within the same process, sharing memory. Best for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing: Runs multiple processes separately, each with its own memory space. Best for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Helps in debugging, tracking errors, monitoring application flow, and improving maintainability. Supports different log levels like DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL.\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Uses automatic memory allocation, reference counting, and garbage collection to manage objects efficiently\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Use try to write risky code, except to catch errors, else to execute if no error occurs, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "- Prevents memory leaks, optimizes performance, and ensures efficient resource utilization in long-running programs.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- try contains code that may fail, and except handles specific errors, preventing program crashes.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to free unused memory automatically.\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- Runs only if no exceptions occur, separating error-handling code from normal execution.\n",
        "17.  What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL indicate message importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork() and multiprocessing: os.fork() creates child processes (Unix-only), while multiprocessing works cross-platform and provides better control.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "- Prevents data corruption, frees system resources, and avoids memory leaks.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- file.read() and file.readline(): file.read() reads the entire file, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "-  Tracks events, errors, and debugging information in programs.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "-  Manages files and directories (create, delete, rename).\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "-  High memory usage, memory leaks, garbage collection delays, and cyclic references.\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- Use raise to trigger specific errors intentionally.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.  Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Enhances performance in I/O-bound tasks, allowing concurrent execution. Improves efficiency in network requests, database operations, and user interfaces by reducing wait times. It enables better resource utilization and keeps applications responsive without blocking the main thread.\n",
